Nertz is the name of a card game my family plays when we get together. 
It's essentially the same as Solitaire, but in a group/competitve sense. 
You have 4 slots for stacking cards alternating in red & black. 
The nertz pile is 13 cards (face-down, except the top card). 
If you run out your nertz pileâ€“you win.

The Aces are in the middle, where everybody can place cards, and 
this is where speed matters.
